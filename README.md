Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project
Project Overview
This project demonstrates the process of performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of choice, using the Titanic dataset from Kaggle as an example. The goal is to clean the data, explore relationships between different variables, and identify patterns and trends within the dataset. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and employs Python libraries for data manipulation, cleaning, and visualization.

Features
Data Cleaning:
Handling missing values through imputation or removal.
Removing duplicate entries.
Correcting data types for consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualizing distributions of numerical variables (e.g., Age, Fare).
Analyzing relationships between categorical and numerical variables (e.g., Gender vs. Survival).
Generating correlation heatmaps for feature relationships.
Identifying trends and insights through data visualization.
Technologies Used
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries:
pandas for data manipulation and cleaning.
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
numpy for numerical operations.
